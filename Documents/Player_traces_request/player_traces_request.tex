% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.


% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES **
%
  \usepackage{graphicx}
  \graphicspath{{../Figures/}}
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.png}
  \usepackage{color}

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/

%\usepackage{amssymb}%............................ AMS Symbol fonts



% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment for describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


\usepackage{mdwmath}
\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/

% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:

\section{Introduction}


\IEEEPARstart{W}{hen} deciding on an \ac{MMOG} to recommend for hosting in South Africa, the advantages of a locally hosted \ac{MMOG} should first be
explored. We feel that the two main advantages to a locally hosted \ac{MMOG} are significantly reduced latencies and access to a local community. The
recommended game should, therefore, exploit these two advantages to be successful in the South African context. A game that fully exploits these two
advantages, will probably posses the greatest traction when players join the local servers.

\section{Background}

We are currently doing research into Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs). One challenge that is present in this field is
how to move from a centralised storage database at the server, to a fully distributed database, hosted over all peers. Another challenge is where to
host mutable game objects, such as doors that can be open or closed, or vodka bottles that can be full, empty or half.

Methods have been found to address both of the mentioned issues, but we believe that we can improve upon these methods. Three methods for object
hosting exist: overlay-based , region-based and distance-based. In a region-based system, a single peer is promoted to super peer status and acts as
a server for a specific region. The super peer hosts all objects and maintains object persistency. Hand-over mechanisms are used to promote another
peer to super peer status, after the current super peer for a region has left.

The second method used is distance-based storage. Distance-based storage hosts all objects on the computer of the player, closest to the object being
hosted. This creates a significant amount of handover overhead, but has the advantage that object interaction for players near objects have very low
latencies.

Overlay storage equally distributes game objects over all peer in the network, by making use of a distributed hash table. In this scheme, objects are
evenly spread out, which means that the load is also evenly spread. The problem with this hosting scheme is that it incurs high latencies, because of
the P2P overlay being created, which incurs a routing cost of $O(\log(n))$.

Each of these methods to distribute and store objects have their own advantages and disadvantages. We are, however, looking at a completely new
object hosting paradigm that would more naturally distribute game objects and allow for a two-tiered hybrid approach to game state persistency. This
new paradigm is that of using player groups to distribute objects over. Player objects can then be shared amongst groups of players, instead of a
single player, with added quorum (voting) mechanisms implemented in the group to ensure the integrity of the P2P system.

We believe that building an MMOG based on groups will allow us to solve many issues related to, not only P2P MMOGs, but also Client/Server MMOGs. For
the grouping paradigm to be successful, the hypothesis that players usually move in groups and interact with other players in groups should first be
established.

\section{Trace data requirements}

With this grouping paradigm in mind, we would like to see how players move around in a virtual world. We would like to look at player density in
different areas and try and determine whether groups of players can be programmatically extracted from the data. We would then like to see what
average group sizes are, how quickly groups move and what the level of churn in groups is, i.e. how often players leave and enter groups.

To be able to see this behaviour, we require player trace data for specific types of in-game areas, for certain numbers of players. What is
diffinitly required from that data is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item That all players in the data set be uniquely identified.
\item That it be possible to observe player movements over time.
\end{enumerate}

No detailed player information is currently required. Some player identifier is sufficient for the traces as the level and motivation for player
movements will not currently be explored.

The issue has been raised about how the amount of data collected could be decreased, so not as to introduce lag onto the server. Two proposed methods
were to only select a random sub-set of the total number of players and another was to only record player positions every set number of trace steps.
Other methods that might also be used to reduce server load is to only monitor players in a limited geographic area and only monitor them for as long
as is required. It's difficult to give a clear cut answer to any of these questions, as one would prefer to have as detailed player data as possible.

\subsection{Geographic limitation}

\begin{floatingfigure}[l]{0.5\textwidth}

 \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Player_density_expectations}
 \caption{This figure shows the expected player density of players in a virtual world.}
 \label{fig_player_density}
\end{floatingfigure}
%
If we first look at limiting the geographic area, there are a few areas of interest where player behaviour might be different. This first area is
that of an NPC questing area, where player receive quests in a city, perform these quests outside the city and then return to the city to complete
quests and trade with NPC traders. The expected player density of this area is shown in Figure \ref{fig_player_density}. It is expected that a very
high player density in the city will be present, with many players moving around, mostly on their own, to complete quests and trade.

Outside the city, there are usually areas where quests can be done. These quests are usually in the form of kill $x$ number of NPC and return to the
quest giver once this number of NPCs have been killed. These NPCs can usually be found in a very specific region near to where the quest was given.
There are usually many quests to be done and many (sometimes overlapping) areas in which to complete these quests. We would like to monitor player
movements in such a ``questing''. We would also like to monitor player movement in low and high level areas, to determine the difference in player
behaviour in these areas. It is expected that higher level areas will show more player grouping, since teamwork is required to complete these areas.
Some movement is also expected in areas between cities, by players travelling from one level area into another, higher or lower level, area.

Other areas that are also of interest are Player versus Player (PvP) areas. Here, a strong element of grouping is also expected, with one or more
groups in direct opposition to each other. The movement of one group in these areas, are expected to be very dependant on the movement of the
opposition group.
